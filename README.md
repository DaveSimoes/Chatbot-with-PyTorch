<h1 align="center">Chatbot with PyTorch </h1> 

A simple chatbot project implemented using PyTorch, designed to provide a basic understanding of building chatbots with neural networks.

## Features

- **Training Script**: Train the chatbot using PyTorch with a feedforward neural network.
- **Inference Script**: Interact with the trained chatbot in a simple command-line interface.
- **Modular Structure**: Organized project structure with separate modules for dataset, model, and utilities.
- **Requirements File**: `requirements.txt` file included for easy installation of dependencies.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Other dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/https://github.com/DaveSimoes/Web-Scraping.git/chatbot-pytorch.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Train the chatbot:

   ```bash
   python train_chatbot.py
   ```

2. Interact with the chatbot:

   ```bash
   python chatbot_app.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to chat with the trained chatbot.

## Configuration

- Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., `input_size`, `hidden_size1`, `hidden_size2`) in the training script according to your needs.
- Customize the `intents.json` file in the `data` directory to define different intents and responses for your chatbot.
